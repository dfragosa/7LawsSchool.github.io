			Welcome to our site.  The 7 Laws School of Internal Arts is dedicated to the preservation and promotion of the knowledge and wisdom acquired throughout our  travels and studies.   One of them being learning under the great master Sifu Kenny Gong as well as Ba Gua Zhang in general.  We offer online instruction and video downloads.  We will be offering seminars and workshops covering the teachings of Sifu Gong and other products on the internal arts in the near future. </p>
			<p>Foundation is the key to building the internal! The internal arts are skill based and not technique based. A foundation which is constructed in two to three years time frame is taught in this system.  Those truly interested in the system will go through a vigorous progressive methodology designed to build the internal body and mind.   The lessons consist of breathe work, the various stages of the static postures and proper alignment of body structure along with circle walking, self defense and weapons.</p>
