		One day in the park of the complex where he use to live in Middletown, New York, Sifu Ben was outside trying to walk the circle.  An elderly Chinese gentleman walked up to him instructing on how to walk the circle properly with a simplistic change of direction.  This began Sifu Bey's long road to learning Ba Gua Zhang.  The single changing palm was ll he knew until meeting Sifu Kenny Gong at eighteen years of age.</p>
